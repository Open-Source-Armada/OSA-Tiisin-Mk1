//Tactics//


This ship is designed to be a small, hard to spot salvage ship for recovering/looting key salvage like mounted weapons.

Built using the Ghast as its base, it is cheap and disposible, and can be used in place of the ghast if you prefer looting on sight after aggressive action.

It mostly served as a recovery ship for close range salvaging at Arma, tho it has also been used by myself around Moon City.
