//Tactics//


Starting as a random test at shrouding the trail of thrusters, I took the shrouded thruster pod i had made, duplicated it, and ran a salvage bed between the two.

The Tiisin has become my go to salvage ship when searching the graveyard, checking event locations or looting small amounts of salvage and/or ore.

The shrouded thrusters are not perfect, and leave a less viable trail when at full speed, this trail becomes completely covered at low speeds.

Going belly down and creeping slowly has proven to be good for slipping by most people you run into.

It is also tough, once taking a full speed collision with the ground from over 1000m high, loosing only one prop tank.
